INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological condition that leads to short-term memory loss, paranoia, and delusional ideas that are mistaken for the effects of stress or aging.
AD does not have proper medical treatment. In order to control AD, continuous medication is necessary. AD is chronic that is it can last for years or the rest of your life. Therefore, it is most important to prescribe medication at the appropriate stage so that the brain is not damaged to a great extent. 
Early detection of this Disease is a tedious and costly process since we must collect a lot of data and use sophisticated tools for prediction and have an experienced doctor involved. Automated systems are more accurate than human assessment and can be used in medical decision support systems because they are not subject to human errors.
Alzheimer's disease is the fifth-leading cause of death for Americans over 65. It kills more than breast and prostate cancer combined. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from Alzheimer's more than doubled. In 2019, 121,499 deaths from Alzheimer's were recorded. The average life expectancy for Alzheimer's is 8–10 years. However, life expectancy is lower for people diagnosed in their 80s or 90s. Some people with Alzheimer's live for 15–20 years. The most common cause of death for Alzheimer's patient.
The most common cause of death for Alzheimer's patients is aspiration pneumonia. Other causes of death include: Injuries from falls, Difficulty swallowing, Weight loss, Malnutrition, Dehydration. The seven stages of Alzheimer's are: Before symptoms appear Basic forgetfulness Noticeable memory difficulties More than memory loss Decreased independence Severe symptoms Lack of physical control

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Developing machine learning model to accurately predict early-stage Alzheimer's disease based on multimodal neuroimaging, with the goal of enabling timely diagnosis and intervention for at-risk individuals.

OBJECTIVE
Designing an in-depth analysis framework for Alzheimer's Disease by examining MRI image datasets to comprehend data characteristics and patterns thoroughly.
Designing and deploying a resilient and precise algorithm for early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease. 
This involves utilizing cutting-edge machine learning and image analysis techniques. 
Exploring the integration of optimization techniques in the design of MRI image processing. 
This design is specifically customized to improve feature extraction, denoising, and segmentation through methods such as L0 Smoothing, Super pixel, and KNN.

PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
The process of System is to be carried out in the following sequence to achieve the Required Objectives.
Image acquisition
Input of MRI image database for pre-processing data.
Preprocessing
The obtained image is then pre processed for improvement that surpasses unwanted distortions and enhances some features important for further processing. Also, the image which is given as the input may not be of standard size. So it is necessary to obtain the required image size. Smoothing will also perform for better edge detection
Segmentation
In this phase segmentation will perform using Genetic Algorithm to find out Region of Interest (ROI).
Feature Extraction
In this process an initial set of raw variables is reduced to more manageable features for processing, while still accurately and completely describing the original data set of acne images.
Classification
Feature will classify for developing Training & Testing System. So system will be evaluate on selected parameter.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, our machine learning project represents a significant step forward in the quest to combat Alzheimer's disease. By accurately predicting early-stage Alzheimer's based on multimodal neuroimaging data, we offer a lifeline to individuals at risk and provide healthcare professionals with a powerful tool for early intervention. This endeavour underscores the potential of data-driven approaches in improving healthcare outcomes and exemplifies our commitment to the well-being of individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease.
